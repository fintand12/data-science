# Financial & Statistical Modeling

This folder contains Python scripts for exploring and testing financial models, focused on regression analysis, statistical testing, and quantitative research.

## What’s Inside
- **Regression Analysis**:  
  Scripts for building and evaluating regression models to study the relationships between financial indicators and asset performance.
- **Statistical Tests**:  
  Tools for checking model assumptions (e.g., normality, independence, homoscedasticity, linearity) and testing the statistical significance of strategies or indicators.
- **Strategy Evaluation**:  
  Assessing and validating trading or forecasting models with proper statistical rigor.

## Purpose
This is part of my self-directed learning in quantitative finance and econometrics. While I am comfortable with the maths behind all these methods, I am trying to see how they apllied in the financial world.  
It’s a place where I:
- Practice implementing financial models.  
- Combine theory and code to better understand market behavior.
