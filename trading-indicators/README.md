# Quantitative Trading Indicators

This folder contains my python scripts for exploring technical indicators and simple trading strategies.  
It’s part of my personal journey to learn quantitative finance by coding and experimenting.
**I understand these are very basic indicators, and as the output suggests, they are extrmely ineffective.

Note; the comments throughout were written to enhance _my_ understanding.


## What’s Inside
- **Technical Indicators**:  
  Implementations of popular trading tools such as:
  - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** – Identify overbought/oversold conditions.
  - **Bollinger Bands** – Visualise volatility-based price ranges.
  - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** – Explore momentum shifts.
  - **Combinations of the above***
- **Strategy Backtesting**:  
  Simple long/short strategies built on these indicators, tested against buy-and-hold performance.
- **Visualizations**:  
  Each script generates clear plots of indicators and strategy results for deeper understanding.

## Purpose
This isn’t production-ready trading software, nor do I intend to use it to trade... yet.  
By coding these indicators, I was able to improve my basic python skills signficantly and apply them in a way I could see being useful.
