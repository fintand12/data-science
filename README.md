# Exploring Quantitative Finance & Machine Learning

## This personal repository reflects my curiosity and self-driven learning in quantitative finance, statistical modeling, and machine learning. It contains projects I’ve built to deepen my understanding of financial markets, develop practical coding skills, and experiment with supervised learning techniques.

### What’s inside:

**Machine Learning Classification Project** – A supervised learning pipeline predicting whether an individual is a white-collar or blue-collar worker based on financial and socio-economic features. Includes feature engineering, cross-validation, and model evaluation (**logistic regression, elastic net, random forests**).

**Technical Indicators & Trading Strategies** – Implementations of popular indicators (**e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands**) with simple backtesting to explore their effectiveness.

**Statistical Modeling** – Using regression analysis **(scikit-learn)** to investigate how market indicators relate to future price movements.

**Data Retrieval & Visualization** – Automated data collection using **yfinance** with visualizations for clearer interpretation.

I’m doing this to experiment, improve my skills, and bridge my interests in finance, data science, and machine learning.
