## Classifying Workers by Socioeconomic Indicators

### This project explores how financial and demographic data can be used to classify individuals as white-collar or blue-collar workers.

Using data from the 2007 U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), I applied several supervised machine learning models — including Logistic Regression, Regularized Regression (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net), and Random Forests — to predict occupational class.

### Key Highlights
**Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaned and transformed financial variables (income, savings, education, housing, insurance, etc.).

**Modeling**: Implemented cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for robust model selection.

**Results**: Achieved a ROC AUC of 0.989 with Random Forests, identifying income, education, and savings as the most important predictors.

**Tools**: Built entirely in R using the tidymodels framework for a structured, reproducible workflow.

This project reflects my curiosity and self-directed learning in data science and machine learning, applying real-world socioeconomic data to answer meaningful questions.
